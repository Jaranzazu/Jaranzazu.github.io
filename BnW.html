<h3>Black and White</h3>
<p>The key to successful black and white photography is learning to see the world in monochrome. It's important to understand that not all subjects are suitable for black and white. There are certain types of photo that rely on colour for impact. Think of Steve McCurry's famous Afghan Girl portrait, for example. The rich colours are an intrinsic part of the image's power.

The successful black and photographer recognizes this, and searches out subject matter that looks better in black and white.

As you're evaluating your subject, try and imagine how it will look in black and white. Pre-visualise the result after you've post-processed (or developed and printed if you use film) the image using your favourite techniques, such as adding textures and toning. With practice, your vision will become very accurate. </p>
